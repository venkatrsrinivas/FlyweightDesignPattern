/*This is a Simplified Example About Flights + Planes.
Premise of Example:
Imagine you want to travel 6000 miles say to Italy, 
and your friend is a new owner of an Airport.
You tell your friend that you would like to go on
a flight that is 6000 miles and so your friend creates
an International Flight with a new International Plane,
and configures the Flight to last 6000 miles. 
You now go on your trip to Italy. 
When you come back, you now tell your friend that you want
to go on a trip for 6200 miles to Greece.
Rather than creating a whole new International Flight with a 
completely new International Plane, your friend gives you 
the same Flight with the Same Plane that you took to Italy,
but now simply configures the miles to be 6200. 
In this way, this Airport essentially only holds 3 Planes + 3 Flights.
However, this simplified model can be extended to reflect 
the true Flights and Planes that are present in an Airport
at a given time. 
This is the example of the Flyweight Pattern. 
That is, rather than creating a new Flight and Plane every time,
we intern the shareable resource, the Plane, and explictly represent
or configure the miles.
